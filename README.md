# Merry Christmas!
I hope that this gift brings you joy and is a fun thing for you and D$ to play with together!
Videogames have been a fun way for Tiffany and I to bond over and a fun activity for when we 
have guests (as you are well aware!)

I've been wanting to convert a Raspberry Pi to a RetroPie for, I think *years*, at this point.
It's my joy that you would have the first fruit (ha) of my labor!

Beyond the obvious video game aspect, I've found that the RetroPie distribution of Linux may
turn out to be a great and fun way to learn a bit about this well-known but wildly different
operating system! That being said, this might be quite the learning curve at times. Please
don't hesitate to text/chat/call/email/etc/etc with any questions you have. Honestly, I've
had to do my own digging to get this setup well for you, but I've been using Linux for years
so I may be able to speed up your learning process a bit. Shameless plug:
https://www.picoctf.com/ is a great place to learn some **General Skills** with Linux as 
well.

However, I may have you covered for the basics:

# The fundamentals

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 3 model B
* 64 GB microSD (TF) card w RetroPie installed
* 2 clear cases, 1 with GPIO pins exposed, 1 with GPIO pins covered
* micro USB power cable with on/off switch
* 2 USB PlayStation-style controllers
* 1 four port USB hub

## Terminology

* Raspberry Pi: system on a chip, inexpensive, performant, great for teaching/learning(/playing retro games)
* RetroPie: most specifically, the distribution (distro) of Linux with all kinds of retro gaming software preloaded, and some user-friendly Linux tools (not as user-friendly as the Ubuntu distro, but Ubuntu is heavy-weight)
* EmulationStation: this is what you get dropped into when you boot the Raspberry Pi. It can be completely controlled with a controller and it will show any console as an option when there is 1 or more ROMs available to be played with that console's emulator.

# Source of truth
When I was trying to figure out how to do stuff with the RetroPie, I went here:

https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki

I learned a lot. This documentation is uncommonly good.

## Highlights
* It's important to know how to leave an emulator, otherwise you may have to power cycle the pi to get back to EmulationStation.
  * On the Logitech controller (blue controller) press and hold 9 ("select" button on SNES controller) and then press 10 ("start" button).
  * Some more special keys (like saving anywhere) can be found here: https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/First-Installation#hotkey


# First source of ROMs
I only included a couple ROMs because I'm not sure exactly your preferences here.

I found the Secret of Mana ROM here, a long time ago:

https://www.fantasyanime.com/index

It seems to be a good clean site with trustworthy material. In general, just be cautious 
when downloading ROMs from the Internet. Certainly do a virus scan on them.

## Secret of Mana
Secret of Mana is one of my childhood favorites! The soundtrack has aged well and I think it's a precursor to Final Fantasy. It's also Co-Op after the second character joins which is not very far into the game.
